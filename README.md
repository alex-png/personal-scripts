# personal-scripts
These are different scripts I wrote to handle minor inconviences in my internet usage. You can use most of them either by copying them into your console, or by installing TamperMonkey onto Chrome and configuring it there.

Scroll.js is for bypassing ad-block blockers. Simply select(in dev mode) the pop-up that prevents you from reading articles due to your ad-blocker, remove them, then run this script to scroll using your arrow keys. works for most pages.
